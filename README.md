# Hi, I’m Archit

I’m a data and business analyst who enjoys understanding how things actually work. In every role I’ve taken on, I’ve seen teams put in the effort but struggle with unclear processes or scattered data. That pushed me toward analytics, and it helped me uncover the systems, workflows, and bottlenecks that shape real performance.

Today, I focus on turning messy datasets and opaque processes into clear insights. I work across SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel to build dashboards, define KPIs, and create reporting setups that help teams make better, faster decisions.

### What I work on
- Improving process visibility in low-data-maturity environments.
- Defining KPIs and establishing consistent measurement methods.
- Building Power BI dashboards and data models that highlight what matters.
- Analyzing funnels, onboarding journeys, and operational data to find bottlenecks.
- Working with cross-functional teams to streamline workflows and support decision-making.
